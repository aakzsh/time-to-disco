      <h3 style="color:white;">Now the game will start. The song will play for 30 seconds. And meanwhile you have to sync to it using the dance pad buttons. It's like a virtual form of dance revolution. Whenever any button turns red, you have to tap it to make it green. Your scores will be calculated based on your speed and accuracy, and will be displayed after the song end</h3>

      <h3 style="color:white;">Have fun playing the game</h3>
